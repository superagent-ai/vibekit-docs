## How it works

VibeKit runs Anthropic's Claude Code in headless mode. This means that the agent will automatically create, edit and delete files if it's in `code`Â mode.

The Claude Code CLI is ran in the configured environment and has access to the network, which means it could be used to connecto to the outside world. This is a powerful feature that can be used to build powerful applications and should be user with caution.
