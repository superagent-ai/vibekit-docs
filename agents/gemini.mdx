## How it works

VibeKit runs Gemini CLI in headless mode with the `--yolo` flag enabled. This means that the agent will automatically create, edit and delete files if it's in `code`Â mode.

The Gemini CLI is ran in the configured environment and has access to the network, which means it could be used to connect to the outside world. This is a powerful feature that can be used to build powerful applications and should be user with caution.
