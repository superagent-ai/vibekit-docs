VibeKit ships with a `ask` mode that allows you to ask questions to the agent without changing any files in the file system. This is useful for quick questions and answers or building powerful RAG applications.

```typescript
const result = await vibeKit.generateCode({
  prompt: "Describe the codebase in detail",
  mode: "ask",
})

console.log(result);
```
