## Motivation

We believe that **every application will need a coding agent in the future**. Whether you're building a dedicated coding environment like WindSurf, Cursor, or Devin, or you want to embed intelligent code generation capabilities into traditional applications, the demand for AI-powered coding assistance is rapidly growing.

VibeKit was created to address this inevitable shift by providing developers with a secure, pluggable sandbox that makes it easy to integrate OpenAI Codex and Claude Code agents into any application. From generating code snippets on the fly to building full-featured coding assistants, VibeKit provides the foundation you need to stay ahead of this transformation.
