E2B is an open-source runtime for executing AI-generated code in secure cloud sandboxes. Made for agentic & AI use cases. You can read more about it [here](https://e2b.dev).

## How to use

To use E2B with VibeKit, you need to configure E2B when creating a new VibeKit instance. You can get your API key from the E2B dashboard.

```typescript
import { VibeKit, VibeConfig } from "@vibe-kit/sdk";

const config: VibeConfig = {
  ...,
  environment: {
    e2b: {
      // Required E2B API key
      apiKey: "e2b_****",
      // Optional custom E2B template you want to use 
      // that has the codex CLI and Git installed.
      templateId: "super-codex" 
    },
  },
};
```
