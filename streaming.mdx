VibeKit supports streaming responses, allowing you to receive data from the API in real-time as it is generated. This is particularly useful for applications that require immediate feedback or want to display results incrementally.

## Overview

Streaming enables your application to process and display data as soon as it is available, rather than waiting for the entire response. This can improve user experience and reduce perceived latency.

## How to Use Streaming

To enable streaming with the `generateCode` method, provide a `callbacks` object with `onUpdate` and/or `onError` functions. The API will then call these functions as data is generated.

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { generateCode } from 'vibekit';

const response = await generateCode({
  prompt: "Create a React component for a todo list",
  mode: "code",
  callbacks: {
    onUpdate: (message: string) => {
      // Handle streaming updates
      console.log('Streaming update:', message);
      // Update your UI with the new content
      updateUI(message);
    },
    onError: (error: string) => {
      // Handle streaming errors
      console.error('Streaming error:', error);
    }
  }
});

// The final response is still available
console.log('Final response:', response);
```

### With Conversation History

```typescript
const response = await generateCode({
  prompt: "Now add error handling to the component",
  mode: "code",
  history: previousConversation,
  callbacks: {
    onUpdate: (message: string) => {
      // Display incremental updates to the user
      appendToOutput(message);
    }
  }
});
```

## When to Use Streaming

- When you want to display results to users as soon as they are available
- For long-running code generation tasks where incremental updates improve UX
- For interactive coding sessions where immediate feedback is valuable
- For chatbots or Q&A mode where responses can be shown progressively

## Streaming Callbacks

The `VibeKitStreamCallbacks` interface provides two optional callback functions:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `onUpdate` | `(message: string) => void` | Called with streaming content updates as they are generated |
| `onError` | `(error: string) => void` | Called when errors occur during streaming |

## Notes

- Streaming is available for both "ask" and "code" modes
- The final response is still returned as a Promise, even when using streaming callbacks
- Streaming callbacks are optional - you can use the method without them for non-streaming behavior
- Handle errors appropriately in your `onError` callback to provide good user experience
